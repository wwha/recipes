Ingredients:

2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
3 leeks white part mostly, cleaned and sliced into rings
2 cloves garlic minced
2 serrano chiles seeds and veins removed, chopped
6 1/4 cups vegetable broth
2 small Yukon gold potatoes peeled, cut into 1/2-inch dice
10 ounces spring greens salad mix
2 teaspoons ground turmeric
1/2 teaspoon sea salt
1 1/4 cups raw cashews soaked 1 to 4 hours
2 teaspoons white miso
Optional Toppings
cashews toasted
Pea shoots sunflower sprouts, or small green leaves
Kalamata olives chopped, optional

Instructions:

Press Sauté to pre-heat the cooker. When the word "hot" appears on the display, add the oil. Sauté the leeks until soft, about 5 minutes.
Stir in the garlic and serrano pepper, the first 5 cups of the vegetable broth, the potatoes and the spring greens salad mix. Add the turmeric and salt.
Press Manual and adjust the time to 6 minutes cooking. When the beep sounds, quick release the pressure by pressing Cancel, and twisting the steam handle to Venting position.
Puree using an immersion blender or puree in batches in a regular blender and return to the pot.
In a blender, whirl the soaked cashews and the remaining 1 1/4 cups of the vegetable broth until smooth, about a minute. Blend in the miso.
Set aside 1/2 cup for garnish and stir the remaining cashew miso cream (1 3/4 cups) into the soup.
Mix in the lime juice and about 10 grinds of black pepper. Taste, adding more salt if you think it needs it. Press Sauté and reheat the soup. Do not allow to boil.
Ladle into bowls and decorate with swirls of the reserved cashew miso cream, and your choice of toppings. Enjoy!
Note: Miso is a fermented food with live, active probiotic bacteria—the good stuff-- and boiling will kill the probiotics. Besides that, if the soup is fresh off a boil, the cashew cream swirl quickly sinks to the bottom of the bowl.
